```rust
pub static PINGCANG_LOCK: Lazy<Mutex<()>> = Lazy::new(|| Mutex::new(()));

    let _lock = PINGCANG_LOCK
        .lock()
        .map_err(|_| BinanceError::Other("Failed to acquire lock".into()))?;

```

Here's a detailed breakdown of what happens with your lock implementation in Rust:

### Lock Acquisition Process

1. **Static Mutex Initialization**:
   ```rust
   pub static PINGCANG_LOCK: Lazy<Mutex<()>> = Lazy::new(|| Mutex::new(()));
   ```
   - The `Lazy` ensures the `Mutex` is initialized on first use (thread-safe initialization)
   - Creates a mutex protecting a unit value `()` (common pattern for pure synchronization)

2. **Lock Attempt**:
   ```rust
   let _lock = PINGCANG_LOCK
       .lock()
       .map_err(|_| BinanceError::Other("Failed to acquire lock".into()))?;
   ```

### Step-by-Step Execution Flow

1. **First Thread Arrives**:
   - Checks `PINGCANG_LOCK` (unlocked)
   - Immediately acquires the lock
   - `lock()` returns `Ok(MutexGuard)`
   - `_lock` now holds the guard

2. **Second Thread Arrives While Locked**:
   - Attempts to call `lock()`
   - If the mutex is still held by first thread:
     - Blocks (waits) until the first thread releases the lock
     - No CPU spin - uses OS-level blocking
   - Once first thread drops `_lock` (goes out of scope):
     - Wakes waiting thread
     - Second thread acquires lock

3. **Poisoned Mutex Case**:
   - If a previous thread panicked while holding the lock:
   - `lock()` returns `Err(PoisonError)`
   - Your code maps this to `BinanceError::Other`

4. **Lock Release**:
   - Automatically occurs when `_lock` goes out of scope
   - Implemented via `Drop` trait on `MutexGuard`

### Key Characteristics

1. **Blocking Behavior**:
   - The `.lock()` call will:
     - Return immediately if unlocked
     - Block (wait) if currently locked
     - No busy-waiting (efficient thread suspension)

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Your version properly handles:
     - Poisoning (thread panic during lock)
     - Converts to your error type via `?` operator

3. **RAII Guarantees**:
   - The lock cannot be accidentally held indefinitely
   - Release is tied to `_lock`'s scope

### Visual Timeline

```
Thread 1: [lock()] -> [Critical Section] -> [drop(_lock)]
Thread 2:           [lock() blocks]     -> [Acquires lock]
```

### When To Use This Pattern

This is ideal for:
- Protecting short critical sections
- Simple exclusive access requirements
- Cases where poisoning should fail the operation

For async contexts, you'd want `tokio::sync::Mutex` instead.
