### problem
Referring to the logic here,I want to create a new macro to execute a statement after a specified number of imtervals

Great idea! You're essentially building a **throttling macro** that doesn't just log, but **executes any arbitrary expression** after every *n* intervals.

---

## ‚úÖ Macro Goal

You want:

```rust
run_every_n!("some_id", 5, {
    do_something(); // will only execute every 5 times
});
```

---

## ‚úÖ Implementation: `run_every_n!` macro

Here‚Äôs a full macro that mirrors the logic of `info_throttle!`, but executes a block:

{% raw %}
```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! run_every_n {
    ($tag:expr, $n:expr, $body:block) => {{
        use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
        use std::collections::HashMap;
        use std::sync::Mutex;

        // Global static log counter map
        static mut COUNTERS: Option<Mutex<HashMap<&'static str, AtomicUsize>>> = None;

        // Init map once
        fn get_counters() -> &'static Mutex<HashMap<&'static str, AtomicUsize>> {
            use std::sync::Once;
            static ONCE: Once = Once::new();
            unsafe {
                ONCE.call_once(|| {
                    COUNTERS = Some(Mutex::new(HashMap::new()));
                });
                COUNTERS.as_ref().unwrap()
            }
        }

        let mut counters = get_counters().lock().unwrap();
        let counter = counters.entry($tag).or_insert_with(|| AtomicUsize::new(0));
        let count = counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);

        if count % $n == 0 {
            $body
        }
    }};
}
```
{% endraw %}
---

## ‚úÖ Example Usage

```rust
run_every_n!("task_tick", 10, {
    println!("Executed every 10 ticks");
});
```

---

## üß† Notes

* `COUNTERS` uses a `Mutex<HashMap<...>>` behind the scenes. If you're already using a static like `LOG_COUNTERS`, you can reuse that to avoid duplication.
* `$tag` must be a `'static str` for lifetime safety.
* This macro is designed for **light, infrequent usage**. For high-concurrency performance, you can migrate to a `DashMap` or `OnceCell<HashMap<...>>`.

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus: Cleaner version (reuse your global)

If you already have:

```rust
pub static LOG_COUNTERS: Lazy<DashMap<&'static str, AtomicUsize>> = Lazy::new(DashMap::new);
```

Then your macro becomes simpler:

{% raw %}
```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! run_every_n {
    ($tag:expr, $n:expr, $body:block) => {{
        let counter = $crate::macros::LOG_COUNTERS
            .entry($tag)
            .or_insert_with(|| std::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize::new(0));
        let count = counter.fetch_add(1, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed);

        if count % $n == 0 {
            $body
        }
    }};
}
```
{% endraw %}
---

Let me know which version fits your setup, and I can help you tailor it further.


### problem
 Is it ok to use this version?
{% raw %}
```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! run_every_n {
    ($tag:expr, $n:expr, $body:block) => {{
        use dashmap::DashMap;
        use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
        use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};

        static COUNTERS: Lazy<DashMap<&'static str, AtomicUsize>> = Lazy::new(DashMap::new);

        let counter = COUNTERS.entry($tag).or_insert_with(|| AtomicUsize::new(0));
        let count = counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);

        if count % $n == 0 {
            $body
        }
    }};
}
{% endraw %}
```

Yes, ‚úÖ **this version is perfectly fine** ‚Äî and in fact, it‚Äôs the **cleanest and most performant** option for concurrent contexts, as long as:

1. You‚Äôre using `dashmap` and `once_cell` in your project (which are excellent choices).
2. `$tag` is a `'static str` (which your macro requires to be used as the key for the `DashMap`).

---

### ‚úÖ What This Version Does Well:

* Uses `DashMap`: thread-safe concurrent map (better than `Mutex<HashMap>` for frequent concurrent access).
* Uses `once_cell::sync::Lazy`: ensures your `COUNTERS` static is initialized only once, safely and lazily.
* Atomic counters: fast and efficient tracking per-tag.

---

### ‚úÖ Example Usage

```rust
run_every_n!("heartbeat", 10, {
    println!("‚è±Ô∏è Running task every 10 ticks");
});
```

You can drop this into any `loop` or background task, and it‚Äôll execute the block every 10 times, keyed by `"heartbeat"`.

---

### ‚úÖ Requirements

Make sure your dependencies include:

```toml
[dependencies]
dashmap = "5"
once_cell = "1.18"
```

---

### ‚úÖ Optional: If you want to make `COUNTERS` globally accessible from multiple macros

You could move it into a module, like:

```rust
// src/macros.rs
pub static LOG_COUNTERS: Lazy<DashMap<&'static str, AtomicUsize>> = Lazy::new(DashMap::new);
```

Then use:

```rust
let counter = $crate::macros::LOG_COUNTERS.entry($tag)...
```

This would allow other macros (like `info_throttle!`) to share the same counters if needed.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Thought

Your current version is solid. You're using modern and idiomatic Rust tools (like `DashMap` + `Lazy`), and the macro is structured safely and clearly. You‚Äôre good to go!

  
### problem
Can multiple statements be executed within  {}?

Yes, **you can absolutely execute multiple statements inside the `{}` block** of your `run_every_n!` macro ‚Äî **just like a normal block** in Rust.

---

### ‚úÖ Example

Here's how you can use the macro with **multiple statements**:

```rust
run_every_n!("task", 5, {
    println!("Step 1: doing something...");
    let value = 42;
    println!("Step 2: computed value = {}", value);
});
```

This works perfectly, and all statements inside the block will execute together every `n` times.

---

### ‚úÖ How it Works

In your macro definition:

```rust
if count % $n == 0 {
    $body
}
```

Since `$body` is expected to be a Rust block `{ ... }`, you can include any number of statements or even early returns (depending on context).

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Tip for Flexibility

If you ever want to allow **expression-style** usage (e.g. return a value from the block), wrap the block in parentheses:

```rust
let result = run_every_n!("some_tag", 10, {
    println!("Running expensive computation...");
    compute_something()
});
```

But note: in your current form, `run_every_n!` returns `()` unless you explicitly make it return something. If needed, you can tweak it like:

{% raw %}
```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! run_every_n {
    ($tag:expr, $n:expr, $body:block) => {{
        use dashmap::DashMap;
        use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
        use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};

        static COUNTERS: Lazy<DashMap<&'static str, AtomicUsize>> = Lazy::new(DashMap::new);

        let counter = COUNTERS.entry($tag).or_insert_with(|| AtomicUsize::new(0));
        let count = counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);

        if count % $n == 0 {
            Some($body)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }};
}
```
{% endraw %}

Then you can use:

```rust
if let Some(val) = run_every_n!("compute", 5, {
    println!("executing...");
    123
}) {
    println!("Got value: {}", val);
}
```

Let me know if you want that functionality added ‚Äî but for your current goal (just executing statements periodically), **multiple statements are totally fine** as-is.

### problem
  
Is it OK to execute such a statement?

Yes, your usage of the `run_every_n!` macro like this:

```rust
run_every_n!("m_rpush", 20, {
    RedisUtil::rpush(&key, &value)?;
    RedisUtil::ltrim(&key, -120, -1)?;
});
```

‚úÖ **is perfectly fine and valid Rust** ‚Äî **with one small caveat regarding the `?` operator**.

---

### üîß Important Note: The `?` Operator

Since you're using the `?` operator inside the macro body, it means this macro **must be called inside a function that returns `Result<_, _>`**, otherwise the code won't compile.

So this is valid:

```rust
fn my_func() -> Result<(), BinanceError> {
    let key = "some_key".to_string();
    let value = "value".to_string();

    run_every_n!("m_rpush", 20, {
        RedisUtil::rpush(&key, &value)?;
        RedisUtil::ltrim(&key, -120, -1)?;
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

But this would NOT be valid:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ‚ùå won't compile, because `?` needs a function returning Result
    run_every_n!("m_rpush", 20, {
        RedisUtil::rpush(&key, &value)?;
    });
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

Yes, your macro usage is totally correct **as long as it's inside a function that supports `?`** (i.e. returns a `Result`). You're executing multiple fallible Redis operations every 20th time, and it's a clean and idiomatic way to throttle writes.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a version of the macro that **silently logs or ignores errors instead of using `?`** ‚Äî sometimes that's useful in a non-critical telemetry or logging path.
